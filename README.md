## What and Why?

This semester, I want to develop an application designed to help individuals get into cooking and reduce food waste at the same time. This idea came from the food studies class I took last semester, in which one of our topics was food waste and cooking. Many of my classmates stated they didn't get into cooking because of how intimidating and complex many of these online recipes were. For example, a few of my classmates stated that some recipes had complex or difficult ingredients to acquire, or search engine optimization made it hard to follow these recipes due to the unnecessary information and added fluff. As a result, Many of these individuals deviated from these recipes to match their skill level and the ingredients they could get their hands on.
Furthermore, many of these individuals were unsure of what to do with the leftover ingredients and produce they brought as they needed to know what other dishes they could make with just those ingredients. As a result, they often let the ingredients rot away or expire in their fridge. Food waste is a big issue in the world, and although most of it is by large corporations, we can still try our best to reduce our food waste by honing and practicing a lifelong and essential skill. My application would aim to solve these problems by finding ways to use those ingredients or produce you have while also easing you into cooking by exposing you to recipes made by people that match your skill level. 

## For whom?

the software targets mainly three types of individuals

1. individuals who want to reduce their food waste.
2. individuals who want to get into cooking without the complexity of having to search for online recipes that are sometimes too complex for their skill level. 
3. people who want ot help others out in their cooking journey by providing them with their insights and recipes that they know are feasible and good. 

## How?

1. Users will be able to create an account, which, after logging in, will introduce them to a simple home page detailing what the app is about. 
2. the homepage will allow users to navigate to other parts of teh application 
3. one part will be a place for the user to upload their ingredients and their respective expiration date. They can choose to upload a picture of the item if they choose to do so 
4. another will be a generate recipe in which a user can generate a recipe with the ingredients they entered and can specify a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) or a time range needed to cook (10-20 minutes, 20-40 minutes, 1+ hour) in which the application using AI  will give them a recipe to follow that will use those ingredients 
5. Users can navigate to other recipe pages to see recipes other users posted with detailed descriptions of how they cooked them and their perceived rating and difficulty of cooking this dish.
6. Users can also navigate to an add a recipe page where they can add their recipe if they want to.
7. finally, users can navigate to a profile page detailing how many posts they made, their saved recipes, and the number of recipes cooked with stats, e.g. (how many easy-level dishes were cooked or how many 1+ hour dishes were cooked).

## Scope
I believe the scope will be appropriate for 4-6 developers. The bulk of the functionality, which is the homepage, creating/registering an account, adding ingredients, creating a recipe post, viewing your profile, and viewing other recipes posted, can be split equally among the team members to implement. Regarding the functionality of generating a recipe with only the ingredients users added, 4 to 6 developers could figure that out within the semester. Finally, in terms of overall design or UX/UI, as long as the team members can agree and have a clear vision of the website's overall look, we should also be able to implement that.
